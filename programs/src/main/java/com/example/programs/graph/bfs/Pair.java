 * <p>
 * You are given an n x n integer matrix board where the cells are labeled from 1 to n2 in a Boustrophedon style starting from the bottom left of the board (i.e. board[n - 1][0]) and alternating direction each row.
 * <p>
 * You start on square 1 of the board. In each move, starting from square curr, do the following:
 * <p>
 * Choose a destination square next with a label in the range [curr + 1, min(curr + 6, n2)].
 * This choice simulates the result of a standard 6-sided die roll: i.e., there are always at most 6 destinations, regardless of the size of the board.
 * If next has a snake or ladder, you must move to the destination of that snake or ladder. Otherwise, you move to next.
 * The game ends when you reach the square n2.
 * A board square on row r and column c has a snake or ladder if board[r][c] != -1. The destination of that snake or ladder is board[r][c]. Squares 1 and n2 do not have a snake or ladder.
 * <p>
 * Note that you only take a snake or ladder at most once per move. If the destination to a snake or ladder is the start of another snake or ladder, you do not follow the subsequent snake or ladder.
 * <p>
 * For example, suppose the board is [[-1,4],[-1,3]], and on the first move, your destination square is 2. You follow the ladder to square 3, but do not follow the subsequent ladder to 4.
 * Return the least number of moves required to reach the square n2. If it is not possible to reach the square, return -1.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Input: board = [[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,35,-1,-1,13,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,15,-1,-1,-1,-1]]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation:
 * In the beginning, you start at square 1 (at row 5, column 0).
 * You decide to move to square 2 and must take the ladder to square 15.
 * You then decide to move to square 17 and must take the snake to square 13.
 * You then decide to move to square 14 and must take the ladder to square 35.
 * You then decide to move to square 36, ending the game.
 * This is the lowest possible number of moves to reach the last square, so return 4.
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: board = [[-1,-1],[-1,3]]
 * Output: 1
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * n == board.length == board[i].length
 * 2 <= n <= 20
 * board[i][j] is either -1 or in the range [1, n2].
 * The squares labeled 1 and n2 do not have any ladders or snakes.
